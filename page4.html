						I’m sure you don’t typically give your toilet much thought, but when it comes to building a tiny home there are suddenly so many more choices. We’ve broken it down for you so you can decide what will work best for your home and lifestyle.

				<h3 class="page4-title">Flush it.</h3>
				<p class="page4-paragraph-flush">
					So let’s get this one out of the way first. YES! If you want a traditional, flushing toilet in your tiny home you can have one. Just like in a regular home you can get sewage hookups and never have to worry about those other toilets. 
				</p>
				<p class="page4-paragraph-flush">
					This won’t be for everyone, though. Choosing a flushing toilet means you will not be able to go off the grid with your tiny home.

						adventurous.</h3>
				<p class="page4-paragraph">
					Compost toilets. You might not have the greatest feelings about them at first, but if you want to go off the grid they’re your best bet.  They range in cost from $50 - $1500, and the right one depends on your own personal preferences. 
				</p>
				<p class="page4-paragraph">
					The cheapest kind is very DIY. You fill the toilet with sawdust, and take it to the compost pile yourself. This option is extremely cost friendly, with the cheapest ones costing about $50. 
				</p>
				<p class="page4-paragraph">
					If you aren’t a DIY kind of person you can upgrade to an active composting toilet, which automatically takes the waste to a self-composting area under the house. These are priced reasonably and hey, it does the work for you! 
				</p>
				<p class="page4-paragraph">
					If you want to get fancy-pantsy with your composting toilet there are models that will insinerate the waste. These come with a hefty price tag of $1500, so they aren’t for every tiny house. 
				</p>

				<h3 class="page4-title">Easy Peasy.</h3>
				<p class="page4-paragraph">
					If you still feel like you haven’t found the right toilet for you the best of both worlds option is a dry toilet. These suck the waste down and package them in a vaccum sealed pack which can be disposed on easily and cleanly.  
				</p>
				<p class="page4-paragraph">
					These are the perfect toilets for people who want to live off the grid but not deal with compost. Plus, they flush like the toilets you know and love.
